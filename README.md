# first-page-project
Hi!, my name is Giovanna! I just started studying programming and this is my first project that i am doing alone, after a few exercise of Frond End that i made through Alura's plataform.

I am still studying so pretty soon i will probably alter some stuffs and add more things as well.

About the project: This page is about Claude Monet, it has a galery section and also a introduction about him, his history and a section about the programmer. the paintings i got from "netmundi" site and the majority of the texts i took from wiki. The deisgn of the pages were made by me, and i use Canvas too. For last but NOT least, i did not use any AI for nothing and this whole Readme i am writhing by myself so sorry any grammar error. I still learning English (i speak Portuguese) :)
